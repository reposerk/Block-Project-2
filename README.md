# Block-Project-2
This program is a simple password strength checker in python. It determines the strength of the password based on how many of the following are true: contains at least 8 characters, has upper case letter, has lower case letter, has a number, and has a special character.
The program depends on the re library. To use this code, add block_project_2.py into the your program's folder and import block_project_2.
Warning: This tool is for educational use only and should not be used for rigorous strength recommendation. This is a very basic password checker.
responsible use statement: This program can give a false sense of security, since it only checks for inclusion of elements. If one's password is predictable or too common, it is not a good password in actuallity and probably should be changed.
